## Problem Statement

In the main method, write code to read a String value using Scanner and print the smallest vowel. Assume all input values are in lower case.

E.g If the input value is "matrix" then output will be a (since there are two vowels a and i where a is smaller as per ASCII sequence).

## Input

    matrix
   
## Output
    a
